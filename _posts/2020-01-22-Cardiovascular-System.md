### Blood Vessels
* **Cardio**
	* _heart_
* **Vascular**
	* _blood_
* **Heart**
	* Double pump muscle responsible for supplying to two separate pathways.

* Arranged so that they continually carry blood from heart to eh tissues and then return it to the heart.

* There are five types:
	1. Arteries
	2. Arterioles
	3. Capillaries _smallest_
	4. Venules
	5. Veins

#### arteries
* Blood taken **away** from the heart.
* Generally carries oxygenated blood.
	* Except **pulmonary artery.**
		* Carries deoxygenated blood to lungs.

* Thick walls (3 layers).
	* Outer connective tissue.
	* Middle (thick) layer of elastic and muscle fibres.
	* Inner endothelium layer.
	* Elastic layer allows for expansion of artery when blood is pumped through (sudden increase in volume).

* Arterial walls are so thick they have own blood supply.

#### arterioles
* Small arteries.
* Just visible to naked eye.
* Middle layer has less elastic fibres.
	* Consists mainly of circular muscle under involuntary control.
	* When muscles contract, the diameter of arterioles gets smaller; muscles relax -> gets bigger.
		* Affects blood pressure, flow, and regulation of temperature.

* What will happen to blood pressure, flow rate, and body temperature when arterioles are constricted and when they are dilated?
	* Restricted
		* BP
			* Increase
		* Flow
			* Increase
		* Heat Loss
			* Decrease
	* Dilated
		* BP
			* Decrease
		* Flow
			* Decrease
		* Heat Loss
			* Heat Loss

#### capillaries
* Microscopic, one cell thick.
	* Very porous.
	* Made of a single layer of cells.
* Present all over the body in the form of beds and networks.
* Blood flow is highly controlled.
	* Often have sphincters between arterioles and capillary beds to control flow into entire capillary networks / beds.

* Function
	* Connect arteries / arterioles with veins / venules.
	* Site of fluid, gas, nutrient exchange.

#### venules
* Small veins.
* Drain blood from capillary beds.
* Carries blood **to** heart.
* Have valves to prevent back flow of blood.
* Three layers.
* Leads to veins.

#### veins
* Has valves.
* Has three layers, like arteries but less muscular.
* Large blood vessels that carry blood **towards** the heart.
* Usually carries deoxygenated blood.
	* Exception: Pulmonary vein.
* Acts as blood reservoir.
	* More than 50% of blood is in veins.

* Fluid pressure is very low to none in veins -> blood flow in veins not dependent on any fluid pressure.
* Blood flows back to heart in the veins via contraction of **body muscles.**

#### coronary arteries and veins
* These blood vessels supply the heart with blood (O2, nutrients) and removes wastes (CO2).
* Coronary arteries branch off from the aorta (immediately after the left ventricle).
* When coronary arteries are blocked, blood cannot reach a region of heart tissue -> the tissue will eventually die if block is not removed.

### Pulmonary vs Systemic
* Pulmonary Circulation
	* Right side of heart is responsible.
	* Blood pumped form heart -> lungs.

* Systemic Circulation
	* Left side of heart is responsible.
	* Left side has thicker muscles wall (has to do more work).
	* Blood pumped from heart -> body.
