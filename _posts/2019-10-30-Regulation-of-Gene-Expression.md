* Prokaryotes and eukaryotes alter gene expression in response to their changing environment.
* In multicellular eukaryotes, gene expression regulates development and is responsible for differences in cell types.
* RNA molecules play many roles in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes.

* Natural selection has favoured bacteria that produce only the products needed by that cell.
* A cell can regulate the production of enzymes by feedback inhibition or by gene regulation.
* Gene expression in bacteria is controlled by the **operon model.**

### Operons
* A cluster of functionally related genes can be under coordinated control by a single on-off “switch.”
* The regulatory “switch” is a segment of DNA called an **operator** usually positioned within the promotor.
* An **operon** is the entire stretch of DNA that includes the operator, the promotor, and the genes that they control.

* The operon can be switched off by a protein **repressor.**
* The repressor prevents gene transcription by binding to the operator and blocking RNA polymerase.
* The repressor is the product of a separate **regulatory gene.**

* The repressor can be in an active or inactive form, depending on the presence of other molecules.
* A **co-repressor** is a molecule that cooperates with a repressor protein to switch an operon off.
* For example, _E, coli_ can synthesize the amino acid tryptophan.

* By default the _trp_ operon is on and the genes for tryptophan synthesis are transcribed.
* When tryptophan is present, it binds to the _trp_ repressor protein, which turns the operon off.
* The repressor is active only in the presence of its co-repressor tryptophan; thus the _trp_ operon is turned off (repressed) if tryptophan levels are high.

### Repressible and Inducible Operons: Two Types of Negative Gene Regulation
* A **repressible** operon is one that is **usually on**; binding of a repressor to the operator shuts off transcription.
* The _trp_ operon is a repressible operon.
* An **inducible** operon is one that is **usually off**; a molecule called an inducer inactivates the repressor and turns on transcription.

* The _lac_ operon is an inducible operon and contains genes that code for enzymes used in the hydrolysis and metabolism of lactose.
* By itself, the _lac_ repressor is active and switches the _lac_ operon off.
* A molecule called an **inducer** inactivates the repressor to turn the _lac_ operon on.

* Inducible enzymes
	* Enzymes usually function in catabolic pathways; their synthesis is induced by a chemical signal.
* Repressible enzymes 
	* Usually function in anabolic pathways; their synthesis is repressed by high levels of the end product.
* Regulation of the _trp_ and _lac_ operons involves negative control of genes because operons are switched off by the active form of the repressor.
* _Metabolism_
	* Broken down into catabolism and anabolism.
		* Catabolism:
			* Big to small.
		* Anabolism:
			* Small to big.

### Positive Gene Regulation
* Some operons are also subject to positive control through a stimulatory protein, such as catabolite activator protein (CAP), an **activator** of transcription.
	* Activator attracts RNA polymerase.
* When glucose is scarce, CAP is activated by binding with **cyclic AMP.**
* Activated CAP attaches to the promotor of the _lac_ operon and increases the affinity of RNA polymerase, thus accelerating transcription.

* When glucose levels increase, CAP detaches from the _lac_ operon, and transcription returns to a normal rate.
* CAP helps regulate other operons that encode enzymes used in catabolic pathways.
