### Digestion
* The process in which food is broken down, nutrients are absorbed, and wastes eliminated (different from excretion) is called digestion and occurs in the digestive system.

* The four stages of digestion are:	
	1. Ingesting
	2. Digesting
	3. Absorbing
	4. Eliminating

1. Ingestion
	* Ingesting, or ingestion, means to bring food into the body.. This is the starting point of the digestive process.
2. Digestion
	* Two types of digestion
		1. **Mechanical Digestion** _physical change_
			* Large pieces of food become smaller pieces through chewing (mastication) of food in the mouth and continues with the churning and mixing of food in the stomach.

##### extra
		* **The mouth** - _no need to study_
			* Receives food, is bounded externally by the lips and cheeks.
			* Sensory receptors called taste buds occur primarily on the tongue, and when these are activated by the presence of food.

		* **The Pharynx**
			* Between the mouth and esophagus.
			* Intersection to:
				* Trachea -> Air
				* Esophagus -> Food
			* Swallowing occurs by a reflex action.
			* **Epiglottis**
				* Guards the respiratory system from food entry during swallowing.
	* 	* Soft palate retracts/elevates to protect nasal cavity.

### Esophagus
	* Plays no role in the chemical digestion of food. Its sole purpose is to conduct the food bolus from the mouth to the stomach.
	* The entrance of the esophagus to the stomach is marked by a constriction that is often called a sphincter, although the muscle is not as developed as it would be in a true sphincter.

* **Sphincters** are muscles that encircle tubes and act as valves; the tubes close when sphincters contract. And they open when sphincters relax.
* Relaxation of the sphincter allows the bolus to pass into the stomach, while contraction prevents the acidic contents of the stomach from backing up into the esophagus.
	* **Cardiac sphincter** separates the esophagus from the stomach.
	* **Pyloric sphincter** separates the stomach from the small intestine.

* **Heartburn** is when stomach contents escape into the esophagus.

### Stomach
* The stomach is thick-walled, J-shaped organ that lies on the left side of the abdominal cavity below the liver and diaphragm.
* Continuous with esophagus and the duodenum of small intestine.
* Deep folds in its wall called **rugae** disappear as stomach expands.

* Main function is to store food, starts the digestion of proteins, and moves food into small intestine.
* Within the stomach’s **inner lining, gastric pits lead into gastric glands.**
* **DOES NOT ABSORB NUTRIENTS**
* Helps to mechanically break up food.

* Gastric glands produce gastric juice.
	* Contains pepsinogen, hydrochloric acid, and mucus.
		* Pepsinogen becomes the enzyme pepsin when exposed to HCl. The HCl causes the stomach to have high acidity, and kills most bacteria.

### Glands of Stomach
* Gastric glands consists of three types of cells.
	1. Mucous Cells: Mucous/water
	2. Chief Cells: Pepsinogen
	3. Parietal Cells: HCl
* Combination of the gastric juice and the action of the stomach turns the bolus into a runny paste known as **chyme**
* **Pyloric glands** secrete **gastrin**
	* Gastrin is a hormone that stimulates the stomach to release gastric juice.
* Pepsinogen:
	* Inactive form of pepsin (inactive enzymes are classified as zymogens).
* Pepsin: Protiase
	* Active form; synthesized when the pepsinogen mixes with HCl in the stomach.
	* HCl + pepsinogen -> pepsin.

* The pH of the stomach is around 2-3 (kiolls bacteria and allows the actin of pepsin). HCl can break down the stomach wall forming lesions called **ulcers** if the mucous layer fails.
	* NERVOUS STRESS -> SECRETION OF HCl -> ULCER
* **Mucous** protects stomach lining but still epithelium of cavity/stomach lining is constantly eroded.
	* Mitosis generates enough cells to completely replace the stomach lining every 3 days.

* Partially digested food enters the small intestine through the **pyloric sphincter.**

### Accessory Organs
* The small intestine is assisted by **accessory organs.**
	* Organs that **food cannot pass through.**
	* **Secrete materials** into the duodenum **via ducts.** (Exocrine).

1. **Liver:**
	* Critically important organ in digestion and homeostasis.
	* For digestion, it makes **bile.**
		* It can make 1.5L per day.
	* **Bile** is. Thick green liquid (it gets green colour from by-products of **hemoglobin breakdown**); another function of the liver.

2. Bile is sent to the duodenum via a duct from the **gall bladder** (where a reserve of bile is stored for immediate use).
	* Bile contains **emulsifying** agents called _bile salts_ which break are fat globules into smaller tiny **fat droplets** in a process called **emulsification.**
		* Physical change / mechanical digestion

* All nutrients absorbed by the small intestine go into the blood stream that is collected into the haptic portal vein which leads directly to the liver.
* The liver regulates blood sugar levels by converting excess glucose and storing it as glycogen. When blood sugar levels are low, the liver connects glycogen back into glucose.,
* Many functions in the body other than aiding digestion, such as _removing toxins_ from the blood and _recycling old red blood cells_ and making _urea._

3. **The pancreas:**
	* It is both an exocrine and **endocrine** (release substances directly into the blood stream) organ. For digestion we will mainly focus on its exocrine functions.
	* Sends pancreatic juice into duodenum through a duct.
	* The juice contains enzymes and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)
	* NaCHO3 makes the juice highly alkaline (pH ~8.5). It **neutralizes the acid chyme** and makes the small intestine pH basic.
	* Pancreatic juice contains hydrolytic enzymes including pancreatic amylase *digests starch to maltose), trypsin (digests protein to peptides), and lipase (digests fat droplets to glycerol and fatty acids).

	* The pancreas also has an enedocrine function.
	* It produces the hormones **insulin** and **glucagon.**
	* Insulin is a hormone that causes glucose in the blood to be taken up by cells (lowers blood [glucose]). It is produced by different cells (β cells in “islets of Langerhans”) in the pancreas then the ones that make pancreatic juice. Insulin is released directly into the blood, and it travels to target cells throughout the body. People who don’t produce insulin or enough insulin, or who lack insulin receptors on target ells, will suffer from diabetes.
		* Glucagon works opposite to insulin: Glucagon has the effect of raising food glucose concentrations.

### The Small Intestine
* Small in diameter (2.5cm wide) hence the name, but is about 6 m long (duodenum - 25 cm, jejunum - 2m long, ileum - 3m)
	* First part is called duodenum, where most of digestion occurs.
	
* Most important site of:
	* **Digestion**
	* **Absorption**
	
* The surface area of the small intestine has been compared to that of a tennis court.
	* The wall of the small intestine contains finger-like projections called **villi** (sing. _villus_), which give the intestinal wall a soft, velvety appearance.

* A villus has an outer layer of columnar epithelial cells, and each of these cells has thousands of microscopic extensions called **microvilli** which give the villi a fuzzy border, known as a **brush border.** The microvilli greatly increase the surface area of the villus for the absorption of nutrients.
	* It is long with convoluted to increase surface area.

##### the villus
* Nutrients are absorbed into the vessels of a villus. A villus contains a capillary network and a small lymphatic capillary, called a **lacteal.**
* **Sugars** and **amino acids** enter the blood _capillaries_ of a villus.
* **Glycerol** and **fatty acids** (digested from fats) enter the epithelial cells of the villi, where they are joined and packaged as lipoprotein droplets that enter a **lacteal.**
* Nutrients are absorbed via **active transport;** the bloodstream eventually carries them to all the cells of the body.

##### intestinal juice
* Walls of the duodenum and small intestine are lined with millions fo **interstitial glands** that produce juices containing enzymes that finish the digestion of protein and starch.
1. **Peptidase**
	* Peptides -> Amino acids
2. **Maltase**
	* Maltose (disaccharide) -> Glucose (monosaccharide)
3. **Nuclease**
	* DNA or RNA nucleotides -> sugar, phosphate, bases.
	* Enzyme digestion occurs until unit molecules **monomers** are achieved

### The Large Intestine
* Consists of **colon** and **rectum** (the rectum is the last 20cm of the colon). Opening of rectum is called **anus.**
* Colon has 3 parts.
	1. Ascending
	2. Transverse
	3. Descending

* **Main functions**
	* Reabsorption of water from indigestible food matter.
		* _feces_
	* Absorption of certain vitamins.
	* Feces also contains bile pigments, heavy metals, and billions of E. coli. While there is question that they are parasites, they provide a valuable service for us. These bacteria breakdown some indigestible food, and in the process produce some vitamins, amino acids, and other growth factors that arena turn absorbed by the colon.

### Peristalsis
* **Peristalsis** is the rhythmic contraction that pushes the food along the digestive tract.
	* 	 Begins in esophagus and continues in all the organs of the digestive tract.
	* Occasionally, peristalsis begins even though there is no food in the esophagus. This produces the sensation of a lump in the throat.

3. **Chemical Digestion**
			* Many different enzymes break down macromolecules to small organic molecules that can be absorbed.
			* Parts of the digestive tract produce digestive **enzymes** (special proteins that speed up chemical reactions). Each enzyme has a particular job to do.
4. Absorption:
