# Blood Pressure Diseases
#school/Biology
- - - -
* **Hypotension**
	* Sustained low blood pressure.
* **Hypertension**
	* Sustained high blood pressure. Over 20% of Canadians/Americans suffer rom it. Usually associated with cardiovascular disease.
* **Atherosclerosis**
	* Due to _plaque buildup_ also causes hypertension due to saturated fats and cholesterol in the blood stream.

* Treatments for high blood pressure include **beta-blockers,** which prevent stimulation of autonomic nervous system.

* **Vasodilators** prevent arteries from constricting. Diuretics cause kidneys to excrete excess salts and fluids.

* **Stroke**
	* Portion of brain dies due to lack of oxygen. Usually when arteriole bursts, _aneurysm_ or is blocked by an _embolism._
		* Embolism can be blood clot, fat clot, or air bubble.
	* Strokes usually cause death or paralysis.

* **Heart Attack**
	* Portion of heart dies due to lack of oxygen. At first, the victim may suffer angina pectoris (radiating pain in the left arm). Death may result if immediate treatment not given.

* **Thrombus**
	* A stationary clot attached to an arterial wall. Slows the flow of blood.

* **Embolus**
	* Thrombus that has become dislodged and moves along with the blood. When the vessel narrows, the embolus gets stuck and entirely blocks the flow fo blood in a small vessel. This is called an **embolism.**

* **Varicose Veins**
	* Abnormal and irregular dilations in superficial (near surface) veins, especially in lower legs.
	* Develop when the valves of the veins become weakened due to a backward pressure of the blood (often made worse by crossing legs, poor sitting posture).
	* Varicose veins in rectum are called **hemorrhoids.**

* **Phlebitis**
	* Inflammation of a vein. Blood in the inflamed vessel may clot, in which case a thromboembolism occurs. If embolism here winds up in the pulmonary arteriole, blocking circulation through lungs, this is called a **pulmonary embolism** and can be fatal.

* Many unaware they have it.
* **Can be caused by:**
	* Diet
		* _high salt diet causes water to be retained), stress (causes blood vessels to constrict._
	* Kidney involvement
		* _renin: hormone that kidney releases to increase blood pressure by retaining salt and water._

##### coronary arteries and veins
* These are vitally important blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle itself (the heart does not use the blood in its inner chambers),
* Arteries branch off the aorta just above the aortic semilunar valve, and lie on the outside of the heart.
* Coronary veins empty into the right atrium.

##### coronary heart diseases
* If a coronary artery becomes plugged and blood is not supplied to part of the heart, a heart attack occurs.
	* Can be caused by cholesterol

* **Atherosclerosis**
	* Form of **arteriosclerosis.**
		* Arteriosclerosis is simply the hardening of the arteries, typically due to old age.
	* Atherosclerosis is the hardening of the arteries caused by cholesterol plaque deposits.

* It can occur in the coronary arteries, the carotid arteries, the aorta, and the leg arteries.

* Healthy arteries are flexible, strong, and elastic. The inner layer (tunica intern) is smooth, enabling blood to flow freely.
* As a person ages, the arteries normally become thicker and less elastic, and their calcium content increases.
* The _natural_ hardening (arteriosclerosis) process occurs throughout the artery system. Atherosclerosis, by contrast, affects only the larger arteries.

* As the plaque builds up, the inner layers of the artery walls become thick and irregular.
* Fat, cholesterol, and other materials accumulate in certain areas.
* This _gradual build-up_ over a long period of time reduces the circulation of blood and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other serious arterial diseases.
* A person having atherosclerosis will often experience symptoms of angina (chest pain), stroke, and claudication (limb pain and tiredness). All of the symptoms are caused by insufficient blood flow due to atherosclerosis.

###### homework
* [Heart and stroke](www.heartandstroke.ca)
	* Look up and learn emergency signs for heart attack and stroke.
	* Male and female differences?

#### coronary bypass surgery
* Segments of leg veins are grafted between the aorta and coronary vessels in order to bypass a blockage. Two to four such bypasses may be performed in a single operation.
	* Three grads would be known as a triple-bypass operation.

* Coronary bypass’s donor heart transplants, and artificial heart implantation (which don’t work yet) are surgical methods that have been used for treatment of heart attacks.

* More than 50% of all deaths in Canada and U.S. are due to hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke, and heart attack.
* Heart and stroke disease is still the number one killer in Canada.
