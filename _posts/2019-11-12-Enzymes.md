### Enzymes Speed up Metabolic Reactions by Lowering Activation Energy
* A **catalyst** is a chemical agent that speeds ups reaction without being consumed by the reaction.
* An **enzyme** is a **protein,** that **can speed up a chemical reaction** without being consumed.
* Hydrolysis of sucrose by the enzyme sucrase is an example of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

* Enzymes are the **sites** of chemical reactions, but **aren’t used up in the reaction or permanently changed by the reaction.** They can, for example, hold reactant molecules together long enough for them to react.
* Enzymes are **highly specific.** Each enzyme speeds up only one reaction Enzyme names usually end with the suffix **ase** (or sometimes **sin** e.g. trypsin, pepsin).
* **SUBSTRATE(S)**
	* The **reactant(s)** in an enzyme’s reaction.

* **E + S -> ES -> E + P**
	* Where **ES** = **Enzyme-Substrate Complex** (the chemical reaction occurs when the ES complex exists). The place where the substrates actually bind on the enzyme is known as the **active site.**

##### how enzymes lower the activational energy barrier
* **it lowers the activation energy** required for the reaction to proceed. Activation Energy is defined **as the energy that must be supplied to cause molecules to react with one another.**
* Enzymes do this **by bringing the substrate molecules together and holding them long enough for the reaction to take place.**

### How do Enzymes Work?
* Because the molecules in question are so _small_ and the reaction happens so _fast,_ we’ve **never clearly seen how enzymes work.** We do, however, have a **good model.**
* The original model, called the “Lock and Key Theory” has more recently been superseded by a slightly more sophisticated model called the “Induced Fit Theory.”
- - - -
##### lock and key theory
* Enzyme and Substate meet during the reaction, and fit together perfectly from the very beginning, like a **lock and key.**

##### induced fit model
* While lock and key is basically correct, we now believe that instead of always remaining rigid, **the enzyme actually changes shape slightly** when it binds to the substrates, in order to get a better, tighter _grip_ on the substrates.

_induced fit model_
* Upon binding, the enzyme undergoes a slight **conformational change** to **more perfectly bind** the substrates.
* Then the reaction takes place, the ES complex separates, and **the enzyme re-assumes its original shape.** It is now free to catalyze another reaction.

###### catalysis in the enzyme's active site
* In an enzymatic reaction, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme.
* The active site can lower activational energy barrier by:
	* Orienting substrates correctly.
	* Straining substate bonds.
	* Providing a favourable microenvironment.
	* Covalently bonding to the substate.

### Enzymes and Coenzymes/Cofactors
* A **protein part** called an **apoenzyme** that gives it its _specificity._
* A **non-protein** group called a **coenzyme** which may help out the reaction by accepting or donating atoms.

##### summary
* Apoenzyme
	* Protein part of enzyme.
	* Gives **specificity** to particular reaction.

* Coenzyme
	* Large non-protein molecules, many are **vitamins** (e.g niacin, riboflavin, folic acid, biotin, thiamine).
	* Helps reaction
		* May participate in reaction by **accepting or giving atoms to the reaction** (e.g NAD cycle)

* Cofactors
	* Non protein enzyme helpers.
	* Cofactors may be inorganic _such as a metal in ionic form_ or organic.
	* An **organic cofactor** is called a coenzyme.
	* Coenzymes include vitamins.

* Anything that changes the shape of the enzyme will affect enzymatic yield.

1. Effect of temperature
	* Lowering the temperature lowers the rate of activity (but does not usually denature the enzyme).
	* Raising the temperature moderately (37° to 40°) raises the rate of reaction.
	* Raising the temperature a large amount (37° to 50°) will denature the enzyme (and therefore lower the rate of reaction). Human enzymes denature above about 45°.
2. Effect of pH
	* Most **human enzymes** prefer pH’s of 6-8.
		* Some exceptions: _pepsin in the stomach - pH ~ 2, in the small intestine - pH ~8_
	* If the pH is too low or too high, the enzyme **denatures.**
		* Denatured proteins are ones that has lost its normal configuration and are unable to form an enzyme-substrate complex.

3. Concentration of Substrates - _has nothing to do with shape_
	* If the concentration of **substrate increases,** amount of **product increases.** The rate of product formation will usually increase too.
	* However, after a certain [ ], the rate won’t increase anymore as **all enzymes are _saturated_ with substrates and can’t work any faster.**
	* If the concentration of substrate decreases, the rate of production will generally decrease as well.
4. Concentration of Enzyme - _has nothing to do with shape_
	* This is what **limits the overall rate of reaction**
	* Providing there is adequate substrate (and there is typically millions more substrate molecules than enzyme molecules), the **more enzyme you add, the more product you get,** and the **less enzyme you have, the less product you get.**
	* In other words, if [enzyme] increases, the rate of product formation increases.
	* If the amount of enzyme decreases, the rate of product formation decreases. The rate will only level off if you run out of substrate, which is usually not the case.
5. Presence of inhibitors
	* Inhibitors are molecules that **bind to the enzyme in some way to prevent or reduce the rate of substrate binding to enzyme.**
	* **Competitive Inhibition**
		* A molecule that **looks like the substrate** can compete for space at the active site. This will **slow down** the reaction rate. The inhibitor binding to E can be **reversible** or **irreversible.**
		* Obviously, the more inhibitors are added, the lower the rate of reaction and the less product is going to be made.
	* **Non-competitive Inhibition**
		* In this case, the inhibitor binds to **another place** on the enzyme (**not** the active site). The inhibitor may look completely different from the substrate.
		* When the inhibitor binds, it causes the enzyme to change shape **at the active site** so the S cannot bind.
		* Binding may, as it is for competitive inhibition, be reversible or non-reversible.
		* This type of inhibition is also known as **allosteric** inhibition.
