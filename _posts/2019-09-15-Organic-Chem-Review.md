### Organic Chemistry
* Study of carbon based compounds.

* Organic compounds contain carbon and hydrogen.
- - - -
##### carbon
* Carbon has 4 available covalent bonds.
* Capable of forming strong bonds with itself.
	* Can form long chains, straight or branched.
	* Great variety available.

### macromolecules
* Large molecules composed of thousands of covalently bonded atoms.

##### polymers
* Long molecule consisting of many similar building blocks.
	* These small building blocks are polymers.

* three of four other classes of life’s organic polymers are:
	1. Carbohydrates
	2. Proteins
	3. Nucleic Acids

* A condensation reaction or more specifically, a **dehydration reaction** occurs when two monomers bond together through the loss of a water molecule.

##### enzymes
* Macromolecules that speed up the dehydration process.
* Polymers are disassembled to monomers by hydrolysis, a reaction that is essentially the reverse of the dehydration reaction.

### Carbohydrates
* Include sugars, and polymers of sugars.
	* Simplest carbohydrates are monosaccharides.
* Carbohydrate macromolecules are polysaccharides, polymers made of many sugar building blocks.

##### sugar
* Monosaccharides have molecular formulas that are usually multiples of 
__CH2O__.
* **Glucose is the most common monosaccharide.**
	* __C6H12O6__
* Can be linear or ringed.
	* Ringed when in liquid for many sugars.
* Monosaccharides serve as a major fuel for cells and as raw materials for building molecules.

##### monosaccharides
* Simple carbohydrates - One unit molecule.
	* _glucose, ribose_
* Contains anywhere from 3-7 atoms.
	* _pentose = 5 carbon sugar - ribose_
	* _hexose = 6 carbon sugar - glucose, fructose, galactose_

##### disaccharides
* Formed when dehydration reaction joins two monosaccharides.
* This covalent bond is a **glycosidic linkage.**

_α - 1,4 - glycosidic bond_
* Common disaccharides:
	* _glucose + glucose = maltose_
	* _glucose + fructose = sucrose_
	* _glucose + galactose = lactose_
