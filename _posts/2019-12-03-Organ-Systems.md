### Multicellular Organisms
* Cells of similar **shape** and **function** are arranged into **tissues.**
* Humans have 4 kinds of **tissues.**
	1. Epithelial
		* Covers and protects surface.
			* _skin_
	2. Muscle
		* Contract to cause movement.
			* _skeletal (striated), smooth muscle heart (cardiac)_
				* Striated - lined.

			* _nerve, brain_
	4. Connective
		* Supports and interconnects body structures; transports nutrients.
			* _bone, cartilage, blood_

* **Organs** clusters of different tissues specialized to carry out particular functions.
	* _heart_
		* lined and covered by epithelial tissues, nerve tissue initiates contraction, composed of cardiac muscle cells, filled with blood.
