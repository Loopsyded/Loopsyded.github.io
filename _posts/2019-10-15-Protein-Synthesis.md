# Protein Synthesis and Transcription
#school/Biology
- - - -
### The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
* DNA -> mRNA -> Protein
(Transcription) (Translation)
* This is sometimes summed up as “one gene, one protein."
* mRNA, once produced, leaves the nucleus through pores in the nuclear envelope, and enters the cytoplasm. This is where translation occurs.
	* Transcription occurs inside the nucleus, translation occurs outside the nucleus.

##### translation
* Translation is the process that changes the RNA message into the actual protein. It occurs at the surface of the **ribosome.**
* The order of the bases in DNA, and then subsequently mRNA, determines the amino acid sequence of the protein being made.
* Each amino acid is coded for by 3 bases (this is known as a triplet code).

- - - -
* There are 20 different amino acids, but only 4 different bases in DNA/RNA.
* Each three-letter unit of mRNA is called a **codon.**
* There are 4^3 (64) codons possible.
	* There are more different codons than types of amino acids to code for.
	* In fact, the same amino acid is often specified by more than one codon.
		* However, the reverse is never true.
			* Any one codon only specifies one amino acid.
			* There is no vagueness in the code.
* The code also contains “punctuation.” It tells when to start reading the gene for a particular protein and when to stop.
* Each codon corresponds to an amino acid, or a “start” or “stop” synthesis signal. And here it is, the most important chart in all of Biology: **The genetic code.**

* The genetic code is universal.
	* The same codons stand for the same amino acids in almost all living things.
	* This **biochemical unity** suggests that all living things have a common evolutionary ancestor.

##### three sites of ribosomes
* P site holds the tRNA that carries the growing polypeptide chain.
* A site holds the tRNA that carries the next amino acid to be added to the chain.
* E site is the exit site, where discharged tRNAs leave the ribosome.

##### 3 subprocesses for translation
1. Initiation.
	* The mRNA, with its **start codon (AUG)** attaches to the “R” site of the ribosome.
	* The AUG codon always initiates translation and codes for the amino acid **methionine.**
	* tRNA binds to the start codon of mRNA. The tRNA has a binding site of 3 bases called an **anticodon** that is complementary to the mRNA codon.
		* Therefore, the codon of mRNA, AUG, is “read” by a tRNA that has a **UAC anticodon.** The tRNA that has this anticodon carries, at its tail, the amino acid methionine.
	* This methionyl-tRNA is in the P site of the ribosome. The A site next to it is available to the tRNA bearing the next amino acid.
		* There is a specific tRNA for each mRNA codon that codes for an amino acid.
2. Elongation.
		* More amino acids are added and connected together to form a polypeptide, as specified by the mRNA sequence.
			* An incoming amino-acyl-tRNA (lets call this AA2-tRNA2) recognizes the codon in the A site and binds there.
			* A peptide bond is formed between the new amino acid and the growing polypeptide chain.
			* The amino acid is removed from tRNA1 (bond breaks between aa1 and tRNA1).
			* The ribosome moves over one codon along the mRNA (in the 5’ -> 3’ direction).
			* This movement shifts the tRNA2 (which is attached to the growing amino acid chain) to the P site.
			* tRNA3 with aa3 can now move into A site and bind with the next codon on mRNA.
			* This process repeats, and the chain elongates as long as there are new codon to read on the mRNA.
3. Termination.
	* The process above repeats until a special codon, called a stop codon, is reached. There are three stop codons.
		* UAA
		* UAG
		* UGA
			* The stop codons do not code for amino acids but instead act as signals to stop translation.
			* A protein called release factor binds directly to the stop codon in the A site. The release factor causes a water molecule to be added to the end of the polypeptide chain, and the chain then separates from the last tRNA.
			* The protein is now complete. The mRNA is now usually broken down, and the ribosome splits into its large and small subunits.
			* The new protein is sent for final processing into the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

##### polysomes
* Often, many ribosomes will simultaneously translate the same mRNA.
* In this way, many copies of the same protein can be made quickly. These clusters of ribosomes are called **polysomes.**
