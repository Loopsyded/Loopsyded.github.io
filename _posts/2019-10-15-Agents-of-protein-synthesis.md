# rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA - Agents of Protein Synthesis - b11

* RNA that is involved in protein synthesis belongs to one of three distinct types:
	* Ribosomal RNA _rRNA_
	* Transfer RNA _tRNA_
	* Messenger RNA _mRNA_

##### ribosomal RNA
* rRNA becomes a **structural part of ribosomes** and serves as a genetic **link** between mRNA and tRNA.
* Ribosomal RNA is associated with protein, forming bodies called ribosomes. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis.
* Ribosomal RNA varies in size and is the most plentiful RNA so it constitutes 85% to 90% of total cellular RNA.

##### transfer RNA
* tRNA is used to **deliver amino acids** from the cytoplasms to the ribosome. There is a different tRNA for each amino acid. The function of each type of tRNA is to bring its specific amino acid to a ribosome.
* the tRNA molecules consist of about 80 nucleotides and are structured in a cloverleaf pattern. They constitute about 5% of the cell’s total RNA.

##### messenger RNA
* mRNA carries the genetic code contained in the sequence of bases in the cell’s DNA from the nucleus to the ribosome.
* mRNA acts as a “go-between” for DNA in the nucleus and the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
* mRNA constitutes 5% to 10% of the cell’s RNA.
