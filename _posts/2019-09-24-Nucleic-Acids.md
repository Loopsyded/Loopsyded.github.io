### Types of Nucleic Acids + Structure
* There are two types of nucleic acids:
	* Deoxyribonucleic acid
		* _DNA_
	* Ribonucleic acid
		* _RNA_

* DNA provides directions for its own replication.
* DNA directs synthesis of messenger RNA _mRNA_ and, through mRNA, controls protein synthesis.
* Protein synthesis occurs in ribosomes.

##### structure of nucleic acids
* Nucleic acids are polymers called **polynucleotides.**
* Each polynucleotide is made of monomers called **nucleotides.**
* Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.
* The portion of a nucleotide without the phosphate group is called a **nucleoside.**
* All DNA is assembled in the 5’ 3’ structure.

			* Purines - Adenine - Guanine
				* Double ringed.
		* _CUT Pye_
			* Pyrimidines - Cytosine - Uracil - Thymine
				* Single ringed.

##### nitrogenous bases
* Nucleoside:
	* _nitrogenous base + sugar_
* Nucleotide:
	* _nucleoside + phosphate group_

* Two families of nitrogenous bases:
	1. Pyrimidines have a single six-membered ring.
		* _cytosine, thymine, and uracil_
	2. Purines have a six-membered ring fused to five-membered ring.
		* _adenine and guanine_
* In DNA, the sugar Is deoxyribose; in RNA, the sugar is ribose.

##### Adenosine Triphosphate - ATP
* ATP is classified as a **nucleoside triphosphate**, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate.
	* Often referred to as the “molecular unit of currency” of intracellular energy transfer.
* Drives many processes in living cells.
	* _muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis._
* When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to **adenosine diphosphate (ADP)** or to **adenosine monophosphate (AMP).**
* It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme.

##### nucleotide polymers
* Nucleotide polymers are linked together to build a polynucleotide.
* The sequence of bases along a DNA or mRNA polymer is unique for each gene.

##### DNA double helix
* A DNA molecule has two polynucleotides spiralling around an imaginary axis, forming a **double helix**
* In the DNA double helix, the two backbones run in opposite 5’ to 3’ directions from each other, an arrangement referred to as antiparallel.
* One DNA molecule includes many genes.
* The nitrogenous bases in DNA pair up and form hydrogen bonds: adenine always with thymine, and guanine always with cytosine.
	* Complementary base pairing.

* The linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules are passed form parents to offspring.
* Two closely related species are more similar in DNA than are more distantly related species.
* Molecular biology can be used to assess evolutionary kinship.
