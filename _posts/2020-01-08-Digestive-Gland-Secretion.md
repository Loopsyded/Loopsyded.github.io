# Control of Digestive Gland Secretion
#school/Biology
- - - -
* General speaking, **the presence of food** in digestive system triggers digestive glands to secrete their enzymes.
* More specifically, **hormones** control secretion of specific digestive juices.
* There are 4 hormones that we need to know.
	* **gastrin**
	* **secretin**
	* **CCK**
	* **GIP**

* When food is eaten, **sensory cells** in the stomach detect the presence of **peptides.** Other sensory receptors detect that the stomach is distending _stretching._ This causes other stomach cells to release **gastrin,** a hormone, into the **blood**
	* Gastrin travels through the blood and finally reaches other cells (takes about 1 minute) in the stomach that produce **gastric juices,** and stimulates its release.

* Most digestion of food occurs in the **duodenum.** The acid chyme seeps in from the stomach and is first neutralized.
* **Secretin,** a hormone produced by the small intestine, mediates this neutralization by stimulating the release of **sodium bicarbonate** by the **pancreas.**

* The presence of **amino acids** or **fatty acids** in the duodenum triggers the release of **cholecystokinin (CCK),** which stimulates the release of **digestive enzymes** by the **pancreas** and **bile** by the **gallbladder.**
* A fourth hormone, **enterogastrone**, or **gastric inhibitory peptide,** released by the small intestine, slows digestion by inhibiting stomach peristalsis and acid secretion when acid chyme rich in fats _which require additional digestion time_ enters the duodenum.
