# Enzymes Responsible for Replication
#school/Biology
- - - -
* **Helicases**
	* Uncoils/unwinds and unzips DNA molecule, breaks H-bonds between complimentary base pairs, unwinds at replication forks.
* **Topoisomerase** _gyrase_
	* Cuts and reconnects the strands of DNA by breaking, swivelling, and rejoining DNA strands ahead of the replication fork to relieve _overwinding / strain_
* **Primase**
	* Makes an RNA primer at 5’ end of leading strand and at 3’ end of each Okazaki fragment of lagging strand so that DNA replication can start at a 5’ end.
* **DNA polymerase III** or _DNApIII or DNAp3_
	* Uses parental DNA as a template, synthesizes new DNA strand by adding nucleotides to the 3’ end of pre-existing DNA strand of RNA primer.
* **DNA polymerase I** or _DNAp1 or DNAp_
	* Removes RNA nucleotides of primer from 5’ end and replaces them with DNA nucleotides. Also removes RNA
* **DNA ligase**
	* Seals any breaks/joins 3’ end of DNA that replaces primer to rest of leading or lagging strand, and joins Okazaki fragments of lagging strand.
* **Single stranded binding proteins**
	* Stabilizes the unwound DNA single strands at the replication fork and prevents them from rejoining.
