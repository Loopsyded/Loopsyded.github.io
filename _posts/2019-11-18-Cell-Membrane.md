# The Cell Membrane - b17

* The cell membrane is the **gateway into the cell,** and must allow needed things such as **nutrients** into the cell without letting them escape. In the same way, it must allow **wastes** to leave the cell.
* A wide variety of molecules and substances but pass through the cell membrane — large, small, hydrophobic, hydrophilic. Molecules of the same size must be sorted out, and the cell must also be able to get large amounts of molecules in and out when necessary.
* The cell allows things in and out due to the **fluid mosaic model** of the membrane structure.

### Fluid Mosaic Model
* Double layer of **phospholipid** molecules.
* Consistency of light machine oil.
	* Fluid.
* Proteins wholly or partly embedded in phospholipid bilayer forms mosaic pattern.
* **Carbohydrates** strung together in chains are attached to proteins _glycoproteins_ or lipids _glycolipids_ of membrane. Function as **identification markers** for cell recognition.
* Is **selectively permeable.**
	* Some molecules enter the cell, while other molecules are not allowed to enter. The cell membrane can discriminate between different molecules that are the same size.
* All living cells, whether plant, animal, fungal, protozoan, or bacterial, are surrounded by cell membranes.

* Integral proteins can _float_ along the surface and form channels for brining in materials.
	* Water is brought in through channels called aquaporins.
* Phospholipids in the plasma membrane can move within the bilayer.
* Most of the lipids, and some proteins drift laterally.
* Rarely does a molecule flip-flop transversely across the membrane.

* **Peripheral proteins** are bound to the surface of the membrane.
* **Integral proteins** penetrate the hydrophobic core.
* **Transmembrane** goes through the layer.
* Integral proteins that span the membrane are called transmembrane proteins.

##### membrane stuff
* As temperatures cool, membranes switch from a fluid state to a solid state.
	* The temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids.
* Membranes rich in unsaturated fatty acids are more fluid than those rich in saturated fatty acids.
* Membranes must be fluid to work properly; they are usually about as fluid as salad oil.

* The steroid cholesterol has different effects on membrane fluidity at different temperatures.
	* At warm temperatures (such as 37° C), cholesterol restrains movement of phospholipids.
	* At cool temperatures, it maintains fluidity by preventing tight packing.

* A membrane is a collage of different proteins embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer.
* Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions.

### Plant Cell Wall
* **Plants** have cell walls in addition to cell membranes. The cell wall lies outside the cell membrane.
	* Bacterial have cell walls too, but not the same composition as plants.
		* Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan.
* **Thickness** of cell wall varies with cell function.

##### three main ways by which a substance can enter and exit cells
* **Diffusion.**
	* Lipid-soluble molecules (alcohol, steroid hormones), water (via osmosis), gases (CO2, O2).
* **Transport by carriers.**
	* Sugars (glucose), amino acids, ions (Ca++, Na+, Cl-).
* **Endocytosis and exocytosis.** _pinocytosis and phagocytosis_
	* Macromolecules (proteins), cells or sub-cellular material.

##### diffusion
* Diffusion is a physical process that can be observed with any type of particle. A universal phenomenon.
* Law of Diffusion
	* Particles move from the area of grater concentration to the area of lesser concentration until equally distributed.
		* High concentration -> low concentration.
* Movement by diffusion **requires no energy** to be added.
	* Adding energy will speed it up.
* Diffusion is a **slow** process. The rate of diffusion is affected by the **concentration gradient** (the difference in concentration of the diffusing molecules between the two regions), the **size and shape** of the molecules, and the **temperature.** Diffusion in liquid is slower than in gases.

* Increasing the rate of diffusion:
	* Increase the temperature.
	* Increase the concentration gradient.
	* Decrease the size of the diff across membranes, **through charged, protein-lined pores in the membrane** (aquaporins) that will not allow anything else but water through. This is called **osmosis.**

* At **dynamic equilibrium,** many molecules cross one way as others cross in the other direction.

##### osmosis
* The net movement of **water molecules** from the area fo greater concentration to the area of lesser concentration **across a selectively-permeable membrane.**
* Cells may be placed in solutions that contain the same number of solute molecules per volume as the cell (isotonic), a greater number of solute molecules per volume (hypertonic), or a lesser number of solute molecules per volume (hypotonic).

* **Tonicity** is the ability of a solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water.
* **Isotonic**
	* Solute concentration is the same as that inside the cell; no net water movement across the plasma membrane.
* **Hypertonic**
	* Solute concentration is greater than that inside the cell; cell loses water.
* **Hypotonic**
	* Solute concentration is less than inside the cell; cell gains water.

### Transport Proteins
* **Transport proteins** allow passage of hydrophilic substances across the membrane.
* Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, have a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or ions can use as a tunnel.
* Channel proteins called aquaporins facilitate the passage of water.

* Other transport proteins, called **carrier proteins** bind to molecules and change shape to shuttle them across the membrane.
* A transport protein is specific for the substance it moves.
