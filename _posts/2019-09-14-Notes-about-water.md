### Structure, Properties, and Importance
* An average male consists of:
	* Proteins
	* Fats
	* Carbohydrates
	* Minerals
	* Water 60%-70%
* All living organisms are water-based.
* All living organisms have some adaptation for maintaining water levels.

* **Only substances dissolved in H2O can enter cells.**
	* H2O carries away dissolved wastes from cells.
	* Wastes exerted from water in liquid form.

##### lubrication
* H2O-based solutions act as lubricants.
	* Certain joints are lubricated by synovial fluid.

##### temperature regulation
* Water also regulates temperature in living systems.
	* Doesnâ€™t heat up easily.
	* Helps organisms maintain a relatively constant internal temperature.
		* **Homeostasis**

* Brain is partially protected by a watery layer. _against shock_

##### sense organs
* Sense organs require water.
	* Eyes are filled with thick fluid.
		* _aqueous humour, and vitreous humour_
	* Inner ear contains fluid to detect and transmit vibrations.

* Hydrolytic enzymes are involved in breaking bonds between molecules.

### Chemistry of Water
* Covalently bonded atoms.
* Unequal sharing of electrons.
* Oxygen has a greater pull on hydrogens due to electronegativity.

* Water is a polar molecule.
	* Small positive charge on the hydrogens.
	* Small negative charge on the oxygen.
	* Leads to hydrogen bonding.

_hydrogen bonding_
* Hydrogen bonds are weak bonds that are easily broken, but plentiful in number.
	* Net effect: Water is sticky to itself.

##### unique properties
* Hydrogen bonding makes water have a low freezing point and a high boiling point, so that liquid is more likely to remain liquid at body temperature.

* Water absorbs much heat before it warms up or boils, and can give off a lot of heat before it freezes.
	* _why oceans maintain an almost constant temperature, and accounts for the cooling effect of sweating_
	* -> This is due to H-bonding

* Water has high cohesiveness
	* Water molecules tend to cling together and draw dissolved substances along with it. 
		* This makes it good for transporting materials through tubes.

* Liquid water is denser than ice because of hydrogen bonding.
	* _ice layers help protect organism below_

* Water dissolves other polar molecules.
	* One of the best solvents known.
		* _called universal solvent_

# ions
* Ions necessary for many body processes.
	* _for nerves to transmit_
	* Ions are formed when ionic substance are dissolved in water.
