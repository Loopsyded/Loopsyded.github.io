##### cause
* During the molecular maneuvering that occurs with DNA replication, if nucleotides are **lost, rearranged, or paired in error,** the resulting changes in instruction of the genetic code could lead to a protein that does **not function properly** when the DNA’s code is translated.
* A mutation is a change in an organism resulting from a chemical change in the structure of a gene.

##### mutagen
* Although mutations have occurred throughout history, Herman Muller, an American geneticist, developed the first experiments to study how and why they occurred. Genetic mutations can be caused by both **internal** and **external** factors. Any factor that can cause a mutation is called a **mutagen** (Dioxins, benzene, UV light, asbestos, DDT, cigarette smoke, x-rays, etc).

##### categories of mutations
* Change will first be reflected in the RNA copy, then in the enzyme or other protein that the RNA codes for, and finally in the appearance of new traits in the living organism.
* There are two main categories of mutations: **gene mutations** _affect only one gene_ and **chromosomal mutations** _affect many genes because they affect entire chromosomes or parts of chromosomes._

1. Gene mutations
	* **Affect only a single gene.** May be caused by a change _substitution, deletions, additions_ in a single nucleotide. The effect on the individual depends on the gene’s role. The sickle-cell anemia is a good example of a genetic disorder caused by a gene mutation.
2. Chromosomal Mutations
	* Occur after **chromosomes** are broken _due to exposure to radiation, addictive drugs, pesticides_ and **reform abnormally.** Pieces of chromosomes can be **lost, added, or whole chromosomes** can be lost or added.

_chromosome mutations_
- - - -
* A mutation occurs because of the _alteration in one or more base pairs_ of the DNA molecule, **garbling** the existing genetic code.
* Sometimes the pattern of normal base pairing is altered, causing the substitution of one base pair for another.
* Sometimes the pairing capacity of a specific base is changed, producing an abnormal base pairing.

##### types of mutations
* Sometimes an extra base is added, sometimes a base is deleted.
	* **Frameshift mutations.**
	* It only takes a single different pair of bases to produce a different or imperfect organism.

		* Deletion / frameshift: _THE BID OGB ITT EDA NDR ANO FF_

* Sometimes a single base is replaced by another.
	* **Point mutation or replacement.**
		* Original message: _I SHOT THE SHERIFF_
		* Substitution: _I SHIT THE SHERIFF_

*  A **base-pair substitution** replaces one nucleotide and its partner with another pair of nucleotides.
* **Silent mutations** have no effect on the amino acid produced by a codon because of redundancy in the genetic code.
* **Missense mutations** still code for an amino acid, but not necessarily the right amino acid.
* **Nonsense mutations** change an amino acid codon into a stop codon, nearly always leading to a non-functional protein.

* If there is a change in the DNA that causes a change in the significant part of the mRNA codon(s), a different amino acid will be translated, and a different protein will be made.
	* Usually random changes are **harmful.**
		* Frequent mutations are lethal.
	* About one in a million chance, the change might actually improve the protein, which is called a **beneficial mutation.**
		* Beneficial mutations, while infrequent, drive the evolution of species.
	* Occasionally, a mutation will be **neutral.**
		* No effect on the protein produced, or it will change an amino acid on a non-vital part of the protein.

##### sickle cell anemia
* Gene mutations can cause genetic disorders.
* Sickle cell anemia, is when normal round-shaped red blood cells are intermingled with some having a sickle shape.
	* The sickle cells block the veins and arteries. As fewer and fewer normal red blood cells are able to pass through the congested blood vessels, the tissue and cells become starved for oxygen and other nutrients.
	* This disease occurs when one amino acids present in the hemoglobin (the molecule of red blood cells responsible for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport) is misplaced because of an error in the messenger RNA which was made by a piece of **DNA with one of its base pairs out of arrangement.**
