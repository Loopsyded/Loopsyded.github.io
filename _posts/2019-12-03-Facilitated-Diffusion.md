#### Facilitated Diffusion: Passive transport Aided by Proteins
* In facilitated diffusion, transport proteins speed the passive movement of molecules across the plasma membrane.

* Channel proteins provide corridors that allow a specific molecule or ion to cross the membrane.

* Channel proteins include:
	* Aquaporins for facilitated diffusion of water
	* Ion channels that open or close in response to a stimulus (gated channels)

* Carrier proteins undergo a subtle change in shape that translocates the solute-binding site across the membrane

* Some diseases are caused by malfunctions in specific transport systems, for example the kidney disease Cystinuria.

#### Active transport uses energy to move solutes against their gradients
* Facilitated diffusion is still passive because the solute moves down its concentration gradient

* Some transport proteins, however, can move solutes against their concentration gradients


#### The need for energy in active transport
* Active transport moves substances against their concentration gradient

* Active transport requires energy, usually in the form of ATP

* Active transport is performed by specific proteins embedded in the membranes

* Active transport allows cells to maintain concentration gradients that differ from their surroundings

* The sodium-potassium pump is one type of active transport system

#### How ion pumps maintain membrane potential
* **Membrane potential** is the voltage difference across a membrane

* Voltage is created by differences in the distribution of positive and negative ions

* Two combined forces collectively called the electrochemical gradient drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane:

	* A chemical force (the ion’s concentration gradient)

	* An electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ion’s movement)

* An electrogenic pump is a transport protein that generates voltage across a membrane

* The sodium-potassium pump is the major electrogenic pump of animal cells

* The main electrogenic pump of plants, fungi, and bacteria is a proton pump

* Proton pumps are also found in mitochondria which drive the formation of ATP from ADP using the protein gradient

#### Co-transport: coupled transport by a membrane protein
* **Co-transport** occurs when active transport of a solute indirectly drives transport of another solute

* Aka secondary active transport, energy is used to transport protons/ions across a membrane at a different carrier protein to create an electrochemical gradient

* The gradient creates an electrochemical potential difference and this energy is used to power transporters to move some substances against a concentration gradient

* Symport is the process when the transported molecule and the cotransported ion move in the same direction

* Antiport is the process when the transported molecule and the co-transported ion move in the opposite direction

#### Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis
* Small molecules and water enter or leave the cell through the lipid bilayer or by transport proteins

* Large molecules, such as polysaccharides and proteins, cross the membrane in bulk via vesicles

* Bulk transport requires energy


#### Exocytosis
* In exocytosis transport vesicles migrate to the membrane, fuse with it, and release their contents

* Many secretory cells use exocytosis to export their products


#### Endocytosis
* In endocytosis the cell takes in macromolecules by forming vesicles from the plasma membrane

* Endocytosis is a reversal of exocytosis involving different proteins

* There are 3 types of endocytosis:

	* Phagocytosis (“cellular eating”)

	* Pinocytosis (“cellular drinking”)

	* Receptor-mediated endocytosis

* In phagocytosis a cell engulfs a particle in a vacuole

* The vacuole fuses with a lysosome to digest the particle.
* In pinocytosis molecules are taken up when extracellular fluid is "gulped" into tiny vesicles

* In receptor-mediated endocytosis, binding of ligands to receptors triggers vesicle formation.
* A ligand is any molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site of another molecule.
