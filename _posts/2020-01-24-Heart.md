# Heart 
#school/Biology
- - - -
* Cone shaped muscular organ about the size of your fist.
* Major portion of the heart is called the **Myocardium.**
	* _cardiac muscle tissue_
* Covered by **pericardium** (outer thick membrane that secretes lubricant). This tissue forms **pericardial sac.**
* The heart is a **double pump** (left and right sides) that are separated by the **septum.**

* In **each side** there are **two chambers.** The smaller one, located on the top, is called the **atrium** (plural = atria). The larger one, on the bottom, is called the **ventricle.**
* **Valves** between the atria and ventricles, called **atrioventricular valves** (AV valves). They control the flow of blood between the chambers, and prevent **back flow.**

* The AV valve separating the Right Atrium (RA) from the Right Ventricle (RV): **Tricuspid valve** (has 3 flaps for “**cusps**”).
* The AV valve between the Left Atrium (LA) and Left Ventricle (LV): **Bicuspid** or **Mitral valve.**
* Very strong, fibrous strings called the **chordae tendinae** support the valves and prevent them from inverting. The chordae tendinae are firmly attached to muscular projecting of the ventricular wall **papillary muscles.**
* Ventricle separated from attached outgoing blood vessels by **semilunar valve.** RV has a **pulmonary semilunar valve** (pumps blood out through the pulmonary artery); LV has an **aortic semilunar valve** (pumps through the aorta).

##### the path of blood through the heart
1. Blood (“deoxygenated") -> Superior and inferior **venae cava” -> *right atrium.**
2. **RA** contracts -> Tricuspid Atrioventricular Valve-> **right ventricle.**
3. **RV** contracts -> **pulmonary trunk.**
4. **Pulmonary trunk** divides into **pulmonary arteries** -> **lungs** (CO2 diffuses out of blood, O2 diffuses in to make “oxygenated” blood).
5. **Lungs** -> **pulmonary veins** -> **left atrium.**
6. **LA** contracts -> Biscuspid Atrioventricular Valve -> **left ventricle.**
	* The _two atria and ventricles contract simultaneously._

#### the heartbeat
* Heartbeat that you can hear can be divided into two phases.
	* **Lub**
		* Atria pumps blood into ventricles _relaxed_.
		* Sound caused by **AV** valves **closing.**
	* **Dupp**
		* Ventricles pump blood into arteries.
		* Sound caused by **semi-lunar** valves **closing.**
	* If there is a problem with valve closing, this can cause **heart murmurs.**

* **Rheumatic fever** caused by bacterial infection can cause a _faulty valve._
	* Usually the bicuspid valve.
	* Surgery or replacement with an artificial valve can often cure this.

* There are two terms that describer contraction and relaxation of heart muscle.
	* **Systole**
		* **Contraction** of the heart muscle.
	* **Diastole**
		* **Relaxation** of the heart muscle.
	* Blood pressure is measured during these two states. At rest, a healthy reading is 120/80 mm Hg (systolic pressure over diastolic pressure).

* The **cardiac cycle** occurs about _70 times per minute,_ and _100,000 times per day_ in the average adult. Each heartbeat can be divided up as follows.
	* **Time**
		* 0.15s
		* 0.30s
		* 0.40
	* **Atria are in...**
		* Systole
		* Diastole
		* Diastole
	* **Ventricles are in...**
		* Diastole
		* Systole
		* Diastole

##### what controls the heartbeat?
* The heart can beat without the brain telling it what to do.
	* Heart is **intrinsic.**
* Heart has its own **special tissue,** called **nodal tissue,** which has **characteristics of both nerve and muscle tissue,** which controls the heartbeat.

* There are **two** nodal regions in the heart.

1. **SA (sinoatrial) node**
		* Called the **pacemaker** at upper back wall of **RA.**
	* Initiates the heartbeat by sending a signal every ~0.85s to make the **atria contract.**
		* Keeps the heartbeat regular. If it doesn’t work, the heart beats irregularly. Corrected with **artificial pacemaker.** _sends electric signal to stabilize the heart rate._
2. **AV (atrioventricular node)**
		* At the base of the **RA** near the septum.
	* SA node sends signal along fibres to the atria and also to AV node.
	* Av node sends out a signal along special conducting fibres: **Purkinje fibres** to the **ventricles** to **contract.**
	* Ventricular contraction begins at the base of the heart and moves up like a wave. This is because the Purkinje fibres first stimulate cardiac muscle at the base of the heart.

* Pathway of nerve impulse is called **innervation.**
	* SA -> AV -> PF
	* While the heart can keep a steady beat on its own, the **heart rate** is under **nervous control.** Specifically, there is a **heart-rate-centre** in the brain. The **medulla oblongata** which is an **evolutionary ancient** part of the brain right on top of the spinal cord.
	* This centre can _speed up_ or _slow down_ the heart rate according to the prevailing stimuli received by the **autonomic nervous system.** Various factors, such as **stress, oxygen levels, and blood pressure** determine how the autonomic system will affect heart rate.

		* P: Prior to atrium contraciton.
		* T: During ventricle relaxation.
