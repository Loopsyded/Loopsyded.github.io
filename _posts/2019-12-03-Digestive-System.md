### Digestion
* The process in which food is broken down, nutrients are absorbed, and wastes eliminated (different from excretion) is called digestion and occurs in the digestive system.

* The four stages of digestion are:
	1. Ingesting
	2. Digesting
	3. Absorbing
	4. Eliminating

1. Ingestion
	* Ingesting, or ingestion, means to bring food into the body.. This is the starting point of the digestive process.
2. Digestion
	* Two types of digestion
		1. **Mechanical Digestion** _physical change_
			* Large pieces of food become smaller pieces through chewing (mastication) of food in the mouth and continues with the churning and mixing of food in the stomach.

##### extra
		* **The mouth** - _no need to study_
			* Receives food, is bounded externally by the lips and cheeks.
			* Sensory receptors called taste buds occur primarily on the tongue, and when these are activated by the presence of food.

		* **The Pharynx**
			* Between the mouth and esophagus.
			* Intersection to:
				* Trachea -> Air
				* Esophagus -> Food
			* Swallowing occurs by a reflex action.
			* **Epiglottis**
				* Guards the respiratory system from food entry during swallowing.
	* 	* Soft palate retracts/elevates to protect nasal cavity.

### Esophagus
	* Plays no role in the chemical digestion of food. Its sole purpose is to conduct the food bolus from the mouth to the stomach.
	* The entrance of the esophagus to the stomach is marked by a constriction that is often called a sphincter, although the muscle is not as developed as it would be in a true sphincter.

* **Sphincters** are muscles that encircle tubes and act as valves; the tubes close when sphincters contract. And they open when sphincters relax.
* Relaxation of the sphincter allows the bolus to pass into the stomach, while contraction prevents the acidic contents of the stomach from backing up into the esophagus.
	* **Cardiac sphincter** separates the esophagus from the stomach.
	* **Pyloric sphincter** separates the stomach from the small intestine.

* **Heartburn** is when stomach contents escape into the esophagus.

### Stomach
* The stomach is thick-walled, J-shaped organ that lies on the left side of the abdominal cavity below the liver and diaphragm.
* Continuous with esophagus and the duodenum of small intestine.
* Deep folds in its wall called **rugae** disappear as stomach expands.

* Main function is to store food, starts the digestion of proteins, and moves food into small intestine.
* Within the stomachâ€™s **inner lining, gastric pits lead into gastric glands.**
* **DOES NOT ABSORB NUTRIENTS**
* Helps to mechanically break up food.

* Gastric glands produce gastric juice.
	* Contains pepsinogen, hydrochloric acid, and mucus.
		* Pepsinogen becomes the enzyme pepsin when exposed to HCl. The HCl causes the stomach to have high acidity, and kills most bacteria.

### Glands of Stomach
* Gastric glands consists of three types of cells.
	1. Mucous Cells: Mucous/water
	2. Chief Cells: Pepsinogen
	3. Parietal Cells: HCl
* Combination of the gastric juice and the action of the stomach turns the bolus into a runny paste known as **chyme**
* **Pyloric glands** secrete **gastrin**
	* Gastrin is a hormone that stimulates the stomach to release gastric juice.

### Peristalsis
* **Peristalsis** is the rhythmic contraction that pushes the food along the digestive tract.
	* 	 Begins in esophagus and continues in all the organs of the digestive tract.
	* Occasionally, peristalsis begins even though there is no food in the esophagus. This produces the sensation of a lump in the throat.

3. **Chemical Digestion**
			* Many different enzymes break down macromolecules to small organic molecules that can be absorbed.
			* Parts of the digestive tract produce digestive **enzymes** (special proteins that speed up chemical reactions). Each enzyme has a particular job to do.
4. Absorption:
