### Functions
* Polymers of sugars have **structural** and **storage** roles.
* The structure and function of a polysaccharide is determined by its sugar monomers and the position fo glycosidic linkage.

##### starch
* **Storage** polysaccharide of plants, consists entirely of glucose monomers.
* Plants store surplus starch as granules within chloroplasts and other plastids.
* Made of fairly straight chains of glucose, with few side branches off the main branch.

##### glycogen
* **Storage** polysaccharide of animals.
* Humans and other vertebrates store glycogen mainly in the liver and muscle cells.
	* The liver converts glucose to glycogen for storage.
	* In-between meals, the liver releases glucose.
* Glycogen has many side branches compared to starch.

##### cellulose
* The polysaccharide cellulose is a major component of the tough wall of plant cells.
* Found in plant cell walls.
* Glucose joined by __β - 1,4 - glycosidic bonds__
	* Because of the bonds, can’t break it down.
* Like starch, cellulose is a polymer of glucose, but with different glycosidic linkages.
	* Cellulose has __β - 1,4 - linkages__ instead.
	* β glycosidic linkages are alternating.

##### digestion of cellulose
*  Enzymes which digest starch by hydrolyzing α linkages cannot hydrolyze β linkages in cellulose.
* Cellulose in human food passes though the digestive tract as an insoluble fibre.
* Some microbes use enzymes to digest cellulose.
	* Many herbivores have symboled ionic relationships with these microbes.
