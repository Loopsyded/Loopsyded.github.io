# Proofreading and Repairing DNA - b14
#school/Biology
- - - -
* DNA polymerases proofread newly made DNA, replacing any incorrect nucleotides.
* In **mismatch repair** of DNA, repair enzymes correct errors in base pairing.
* DNA can be damaged by chemicals, radioactive emissions, X-rays, UV light, and certain molecules (in cigarette smoke for example).
* In **nucleotide excision repair,** a **nuclease** cuts out and replaces damaged stretches of DNA.

### Replicating Ends of DNA Molecules
* Limitations of DNA polymerase create problems for the linear DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes.
* The usual replication machinery provides no way to complete the 5â€™ ends, so repeated rounds of replication produce shorter DNA molecules.

* Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA molecules have at their ends nucleotide sequences called **telomeres.**
* Telomeres do not prevent the shortening of DNA molecules, but they do postpone the erosion of genes near the ends of DNA molecules.
* It has been proposed that the shortening of telomeres is connected to aging.

* If chromosomes of germ cells became shorter in every cell cycle, essential genes would eventually be missing rom the gametes they produce
* An enzyme called **telomerase** catalyzes the lengthening of telomeres in germ cells.

##### chromosome structure
* **Chromatin** is a complex of DNA and protein, and is found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
	* _DNA is usually in chromatin form except for replication._
* **Histones** are proteins that are responsible for the first level of DNA packing in chromatin.
	* _DNA wrapped around histones are unreadable._
* **Nucleosome** is a combination of a histone and the wrapped section of DNA surrounding it.
