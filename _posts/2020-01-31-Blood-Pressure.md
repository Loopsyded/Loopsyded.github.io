# Blood Pressure
#school/Biology

* **Pulse**
	* The expanding and recoiling of an arterial wall that can be felt in any artery that runs near the surface of the body.
		* Radial artery in wrist, carotid artery in neck are common places to check. Pulse rate indicates the rate of heartbeat.
* **Blood pressure**
	* The pressure of blood against the wall of a vessel, created by the pumping action of the heart.
		* Lower blood pressure than usual reduces capacity to transport blood.
		* Higher blood pressure than usual can lead to artery weakening and eventual rupturing.

### Blood Pressure Regulation - Baroreceptors
* **Baroreceptors**
	* Special blood pressure receptors located in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries that are sensitive to high blood pressure.
	* Sends nerve impulse to brain to suppress the **sympathetic** “speed up” nerve and stimulates the **parasympathetic** nerve.
	* This slows down movement of blood into arteries, lowering blood pressure.

* Low blood pressure is regulated by the sympathetic nerve, without a message being sent to the brain from the baroreceptors -> nerve is not turned off and results in increased blood flow and increased blood pressure.

##### measuring blood pressure
* Measure blood pressure with an instrument called a **sphygmomanometer.**

* _Systolic blood pressure_
	* Highest arterial pressure reached during ejection of blood from the heart. Occurs while the ventricles are contracted.
* _Diastolic blood pressure_
	* Lowest arterial pressure. Occurs while the ventricles are relaxing.

* Normal resting blood pressure is 120 mm Hg over 80 mm Hg in brachial artery of arm (120/80). Of course, blood pressure decreases with distance from left ventricle. It is higher in the arteries than in the arterioles.
* Blood pressure accounts for the flow of blood in the arteries and arterioles, while **skeletal muscle contractions** accounts of the flow of blood in the venules and veins.
