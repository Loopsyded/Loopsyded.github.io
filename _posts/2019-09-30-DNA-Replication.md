### DNA
##### structure
* DNA is the molecular basis of inheritance.
* It is double stranded, helical, polynucleotide.
* Subunits: Nucleotides
	* Four different nucleotides that have different nitrogenous bases.
		* Purines:
			1. Adenine
			2. Guanine
		* Pyrimidines:
			1. Cytosine
			2. Uracil
			3. Thymine

* DNA is a ladder-like double strand of nucleotides.
	* Two nitrogen bases are linked to form the rungs of the ladder.
	* Alternating sequence of sugar-phosphate backbone forms the upright of the ladder.
	* Complementary base pairing leads to A-T, G-C.
		* A-T is a double hydrogen bond.
		* G-C is a triple hydrogen bond.

##### genes and chromosomes
* Genes are the **units of inheritance** that control particular characteristics or capabilities of an organism. Genes are located on the chromosomes of the cell nucleus and consists of segments of DNA molecules.
	* A gene consists of a sequence of about 1000 DNA base pairs (though there is considerable variation in this length). About 175,000 genes compose the DNA molecule of a single human chromosome. The genes act in pairs that **dictate traits.**
		* Genes control cellular chemical reactions by directing the formation of enzymes.

##### replication
* DNA making individual copies of itself.
* Inherent in DNA’s structure is a mechanism for reproducing itself. Before a cell can divide, all of the DNA must be duplicated.
* This duplication process is called replication.
* Each strand of DNA can be viewed as a template: like a potter’s mould, it can produce a “reverse image” copy of itself.
	* _complementary copy_
* Each strand of DNA produced has a sequence of bases exactly complementary to the template strand.

##### Chargaff’s Rules
* Chargaff’s rules state that in any species there is an equal number of A and T bases, and an equal number of G and C cases.

### Sequence of Events in Replication.
1. _Unzipping_
	* The DNA double helix unwinds, and the two strands of DNA separate; hydrogen bonds between the bases break.
2. _Complementary base pairing_
	* New nucleotides move in to pair up with bases of each template strand of DNA. These new nucleotides are always floating around within the nucleoplasm.
3. _Adjacent Nucleotides bond_
	* Sugar-phosphate bonds form adjacent nucleotides of the new strand to complete the molecule. The new molecule winds into a double helix.

* Each strand of DNA produced contains one “old” strand (the template) and one new strand. This is known as “semi-conservative” replication.
* Since half of the original molecule is conserved in each of the new molecules, this ensures that there will be very, very accurate replication of the parent molecule.
* This process proceeds by the action of several very specific enzymes.
* Product of replication by DNA molecule is two complete double-stranded DNA molecules, each with one new strand and one original strand that acted as a template for replication.

_summary of DNA replication_

##### beginning of replication
* Replication begins at special sites called **origins of replication**, where the two DNA strands are separated, opening up a replication “bubble.”
* A eukaryotic chromosome may have hundreds or even thousands of organs of replication.
* Replication proceeds in both directions from each origin, until the entire molecule is copied.
###### enzymes

* At the end of each replication bubble is a **replication fork**, a Y-shaped region where new DNA strands are elongating.

* **Helicases** are enzymes that untwist the double helix at the replication forks.

* **Single-strand binding protein** binds to and stabilizes single-stranded DNA until it can be used as a template.

* **Topoisomerase** corrects “overwinding” ahead of replication forks by breaking, swivelling, and rejoining DNA strands.

* **Primase** can start an RNA chain from scratch and adds RNA nucleotides one at a time using the parental DNA as a template.
	* The primer is short (5-10 nucleotides long), and the 3’ end serves as the starting point for the new DNA strand.

* **DNA polymerases** catalyze the elongation of new DNA at a replication fork.
	* DNA polymerases cannot initiate synthesis of a polynucleotide.
	* They can only add nucleotides to the 3’ end.
* The initial nucleotide strand is a short **RNA primer**

##### antiparallel elongation
* The antiparallel structure of the double helix (two strands oriented in opposite directions) affects replication.
* DNA polymerases add nucleotides only to the free 3’ end of a growing strand; therefore, a new DNA strand can elongate only in the 5’ to 3’ direction.

* Along one template strand of DNA, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a **leading strand** continuously, moving toward the replication fork.
* To elongate the other new strand, called the **lagging strand,** DNA polymerase must work in the direction away from the replication work.
* The lagging strand is synthesized as a serious of segments called **Okazaki fragments,** which are joined together by **DNA ligase.**
