# RNA and Transcription

### RNA
##### Ribonucleic Acid - How DNA communicates its message
* RNA is the genetic material of some viruses and is necessary in all organisms for protein synthesis to occur.
	* _RNA could have been the “original” nucleic acid when life first arose on Earth some 3.8 billion years ago._
* Like DNA, all RNA molecules have a similar chemical organization, consisting of nucleotides.

##### structure
* Like DNA, each RNA nucleotide is also composed of three subunits:
	1. A 5-carbon sugar called **Ribose.**
	2. A **phosphate** group that is attached to one end of the sugar molecule.
	3. One of several different **nitrogenous bases** linked to the opposite end of the ribose.

* There is one base that is different from DNA - Uracil is used instead of thymine.
* RNA is **single-stranded,** unlike DNA which is double stranded. RNA, therefore, is not a double helix.

##### RNA production
* RNA is produced from DNA by a process called **transcription.** The steps of transcription are as follows:
	1. A specific section of DNA unwinds, exposing a set of bases.
	2. Along one strand of DNA (called the **missense/antisense** strand), complementary RNA bases are brought in. In RNA, Uracil binds to the Adenine on DNA. As in DNA, cytosine binds to guanine. The other strand of the DNA molecule (the “sense” strand), isn’t read in eukaryotic cells.
		* The DNA template is known as the missense, whereas the RNA strand replicated is known as the sense strand.
	3. Adjacent RNA nucleotides form sugar-phosphate bonds.
	4. The RNA strand is released from DNA (RNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid).
	5. The DNA molecule rewinds, and returns to its normal double helix form.
	6. Once produced, the mRNA strand is often processed (certain sections called introns are cut out, a _Poly-A_ tail is added to the 3’ end, and a _cap_ is added to the 5’ end).
		* The 5’ end receives a modified nucleotide 5’ cap.
		* The 3’ end gets a poly-A tail.
			* These modifications share several functions.
				* They seem to facilitate the export of mRNA.
				* The protects mRNA from hydrolytic enzymes.
				* They help ribosomes attach to the 5’ end.

		* Most eukaryotic genes and their RNA transcripts have long **noncoding stretches** of nucleotides that lie between coding regions.
			* Noncoding regions are called intervening sequences, or **introns.**
		* Other regions are called **exons** because they are eventually expressed, usually translated into amino acid sequences.
		* **RNA splicing** removes introns and joins exons, creating an mRNA molecule with a continuous coding sequence.

##### after transcription
* RNA can then leave the nucleus and go into the cytoplasm.
* The enzyme involved in transcription is known as **RNA polymerase.**
* This process occurs in the nucleus and, in particular, **dark coloured spots** in the nucleus called **nucleoli** (singular = nucleolus).
