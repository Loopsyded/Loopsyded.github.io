### Acids and Bases
* Acids are compounds that dissociate in water and release H+ ions.
* Bases are compounds that dissociate in water and release OH- ions.

* Water is both an acid and a base.

##### pH scale
*  pH is a measure of the **concentration of hydrogen ions.**
	* Amount of He in a solution.
		* _lower the PH, the more acidic_
		* _higher the PH, the more basic_
	* pH can be calculated using the following formula.
		* pH = -log [H+]
	* pH 7 is considered neutral.

* pH is a logarithmic scale.
	* Each level is a change with a magnitude of 10.

##### buffers
* All living things need to maintain a constant pH.
	* If pH changes, it can cause enzymes (the chemical helpers that run the chemical reactions to life) to denature.
		* _change shape_
	* **Buffers keep pH constant.**

* A buffer is a chemical or combination of chemicals that can take up excess hydrogen ions or excess hydroxide ions.
	* Buffers resist changes in pH when acid or bases are added.
