<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
  I am highly independent as a result of living on my own over the past year. Since September of 2018, to prevent my grandparents from having to live in a senior's home, my parents have moved in with them to provide care. This past year has moulded and transformed me. Cooking for myself, and learning to create weekly budgets for groceries and other necessities have helped me to mature considerably. Moreover, the newfound responsibilities have not hindered my studies; on the contrary, they have taught me to be accountable for my own future. In order to prepare for university, I resolved to challenge myself this year academically by studying both pre-calculus and calculus as well as chemistry, physics, and biology honours. It was not at all easy for me, and I learned the hard way to persevere regardless of the setbacks from time to time. Living alone has helped me to be more tenacious, and I am rarely discouraged by my academics. Despite the heavy course load, I have greatly enjoyed all of the courses I chose this year; there is no doubt in my mind that my passions lie within the sciences. The sense of fulfillment I have experienced while studying reaffirms my determination to continuously toil to be accepted into my program of choice.
